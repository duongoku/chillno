My self-learning project to improve Rust programming skills, inspired by [this blog](howqueryengineswork.com) and [this project](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase)

## Target
Every great film needs a Russian-based supervillain. And I think Clickhouse is a great candidate for this role.

So the target of this project is to beat ClickHouse (I currently don't know how though).
